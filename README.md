Google Colaboratory Notebooks

### Usage
Some of these don't display properly in GitHub. For instance, many of the notebooks display a lot of LaTeX which often doesn't render properly here, or they may rely on interactive features only available in Colaboratory/Jupyter. Just click on the `Open in Colab` button at the top of a notebook to view it as intended.
